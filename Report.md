## The Goal
* **Project** : [Atom/teletype](https://github.com/atom/teletype)
* **Type** : Live-collaboration tool
* **Objective** : Solve a minor UX problem

[Teletype](https://teletype.atom.io/) is an official package for [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/). It enables live-cooperation on the same document (useful for pair programming, note taking, etc).

When we started using it, I noticed that on small windows (either by the screen size or the window's manual resize), a feature that is intended to provide the user the information on who is connected to the document gets in the way and reduces code readability. After a while it also became useless because most of the time we don't need to know who is on the workspace. This is backed by a poll which tells us that [89.3% of the userbase only use 2 participants per portal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2988/34171430-4c998816-e4bc-11e7-8a13-34b21885733c.png).

Here is an illustration of the problem :
