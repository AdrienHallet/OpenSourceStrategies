# LINGI2401 : Open Source Strategy for Software Development
*Please note that the (ethical, political, ...) content of this summary does not reflect the views of the writers and are only based on the lecture.*

* **Lecturer** : Lionel Dricot (@uclouvain.be - lionel@ploum.net)

## Administrative talk
We will discuss :
* Licenses
* Business models
* Community
* Political aspects
* Security & Privacy
* Interoperability
* Decentralisation
* (if we have time) Bitcoin & Blockchain

Slides available on http://github.com/ploum/lingi2401 this course is an open source project. You are free to partake in its development.

Use Github ticket system to ask questions (or email if it's a private one). The goal of this course is also to prepare us to LINGI2402.

### The project
The goal is to **contribute to an open source project**. The contribution should make **sense** and be sent **2 weeks before the blocus** with a **report documenting the contribution and the process (markdown format, do whatever you want).**

1. Choose an open source project
2. Validate it with Lionel Dricot (merge on the \*.csv on Github. If merge accepted, we can have the project)
3. Complete the report day-to-day in our open source adventure

*Ideally, the contribution should be a small fix, feature, typo. We are encouraged to go outside our comfort zone.*

### The exam
* Laptop and internet allowed during the exam (no need to study)
* It's a situation-based exam

Contains :
* Face to face meeting
* Discuss about the contribution and the report
* Discuss concepts seen in the classroom
* The lecturer provides an evaluation grid and we fill it together

## What is a free software ?
It's a software that :
* You can **modify**
* Is protected by a **license** (automatic in Belgium)
* You can **redistribute**

At university, we are studying free softwares because no company can reinvent the wheel. Either they build their own (not good) or they base their new content on free, open content.

**Market University** : The university makes people fit the market (mainly in terms of skills)

## What is freedom ?
Freedom is :
* Lack of constraints
* Choices

*Example : A conference (see slides) where we have a constraint and we want to put the software's performances between those upper and lower bounds. Here, just by controlling the temperature of the engine, you can put the performances right in the right bounds.
James Liang is the engineer that managed to do that, but he's now in jail because he was the Volkswagen engineer that managed to lower the CO2 emissions levels during a testing environment.*

*His boss put the blame on him, and the CEO is obviously not in prison.*

*This example is only the beginning. They are many others (killing drones, AI populated kill lists, self-driving lists, ...). What code are we willing to do to keep our job ? What code are we ashamed about.*

This example is to show that we are not a cog in the machine. **Market univesity is (allegedly) bullshit.** We have nuances between that market-driven university and the **Humboldtian university** that aims to create better, more responsible people. The choice between the two is not binary. We can be a bit of both.
