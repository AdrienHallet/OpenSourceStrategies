# LINGI2401 : Open Source Strategy for Software Development
*Please note that the (ethical, political, ...) content of this summary does not reflect the views of the writers and are only based on the lecture.*

* **Lecturer** : Lionel Dricot (@uclouvain.be - lionel@ploum.net)

## Administrative talk
We will discuss :
* Licenses
* Business models
* Community
* Political aspects
* Security & Privacy
* Interoperability
* Decentralisation
* (if we have time) Bitcoin & Blockchain

Slides available on http://github.com/ploum/lingi2401 this course is an open source project. You are free to partake in its development.

Use Github ticket system to ask questions (or email if it's a private one). The goal of this course is also to prepare us to LINGI2402.

### The project
The goal is to **contribute to an open source project**. The contribution should make **sense** and be sent **2 weeks before the blocus** with a **report documenting the contribution and the process (markdown format, do whatever you want).**

1. Choose an open source project
2. Validate it with Lionel Dricot (merge on the \*.csv on Github. If merge accepted, we can have the project)
3. Complete the report day-to-day in our open source adventure

*Ideally, the contribution should be a small fix, feature, typo. We are encouraged to go outside our comfort zone.*

### The exam
* Laptop and internet allowed during the exam (no need to study)
* It's a situation-based exam

Contains :
* Face to face meeting
* Discuss about the contribution and the report
* Discuss concepts seen in the classroom
* The lecturer provides an evaluation grid and we fill it together

## What is a free software ?
It's a software that :
* You can **modify**
* Is protected by a **license** (automatic in Belgium)
* You can **redistribute**

At university, we are studying free softwares because no company can reinvent the wheel. Either they build their own (not good) or they base their new content on free, open content.

**Market University** : The university makes people fit the market (mainly in terms of skills)

## What is freedom ?
Freedom is :
* Lack of constraints
* Choices

*Example : A conference (see slides) where we have a constraint and we want to put the software's performances between those upper and lower bounds. Here, just by controlling the temperature of the engine, you can put the performances right in the right bounds.
James Liang is the engineer that managed to do that, but he's now in jail because he was the Volkswagen engineer that managed to lower the CO2 emissions levels during a testing environment.*

*His boss put the blame on him, and the CEO is obviously not in prison.*

*This example is only the beginning. They are many others (killing drones, AI populated kill lists, self-driving lists, ...). What code are we willing to do to keep our job ? What code are we ashamed about.*

This example is to show that we are not a cog in the machine. **Market univesity is (allegedly) bullshit.** We have nuances between that market-driven university and the **Humboldtian university** that aims to create better, more responsible people. The choice between the two is not binary. We can be a bit of both.

## History of free softwares

At first, every software was free (besides the expensive hardware). Then the commercial softwares came, there was still an exchange of those software around hackers (no internet yet).

In 1980, in the M.I.T., a new printer arrived (Xerox 9700). The queue for the whole building was quite long so a guy wrote a message-system to indicate to the user when the print job was finished. The company, on the other hand, copyrighted the source code and the new snippet was not allowed. The guy (Richard Stallman) then created the free software movement.

### The movement
* Free to use
* Free to study
* Free to modify
* Free to redistribute

*You are free to use your own definition of freedom.*

### GNU (GNU is Not Unix)
* Free operating system
* Lot of tools without any system
* GNU/GPL - 1989
* GNU/Hurd - 1990

The GPL license is a really important project where every using layer must have the GPL redistribution. It kind of "infects" the softwares using it with its license.

### Linux (GNU/Linux)
In 1991, Linus Torvalds wrote a mailing list where he asked for feedback on another OS because he was starting his own. Linux was born (amen) !
Only one year after, a first distribution was born (SLS), many other followed (Ubuntu was in 2004).

### Open source
Free software are a bit aggressive against copyrighted code. The Open Source movement aims to be less political. The philosophy is now about efficiency. Open Source code allows more people to collaborate, more fixes to happen, ... It's better for the software (and it also helps non-free software).
